This Program is an Algorithm Visualizer for the Double Selection Sort Algorithm. Using pygame visuals, scripy.io wav sounds, and 
keyboard inputs make visualizing algorithms like this one easy to understand. 

Before running this program make sure to install the following python libraries if you haven't already:
1. pygame
2. numpy (latest version if possible)
3. scripy.io.wavfile (pip / pip3 install Scripy)

Enjoy!
